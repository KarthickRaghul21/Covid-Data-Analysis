# Covid-Data-Analysis
This dataset contains an enormous number of anonymized patient-related information including pre-conditions. The raw dataset consists of 21 unique features which was then cleaned. 

The aim of this project is to analyze this Covid dataset. The objective here is to uncover meaningful insights and visualize the data to gain a better understanding of the pandemic's impact on different demographic groups and risk factors.
The dataset is cleaned at first where a handful of missing data were deleted and prepared in such a way that the number of rows is reduced in order for the smooth usablitily of the dataset without much memory usage.

In this repository you can find a **Word document** where the findings are documented in order for the viewers to understand it clearly without any doubt and a **Tableau** file is also attached which has the visualizations.
